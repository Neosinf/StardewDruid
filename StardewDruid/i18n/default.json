    // Conversations
    // 1 Intro conversation
    "DialogueData.324.90": "Blackfeather: It's strange to see wisps gather so far from the shoreline. Did you summon them here?",

    "DialogueData.324.91": "The wisps are the dreams of the sleeping kings made manifest in this world. This space has a special significance to the Weald, and something here remains a source of discontent for those on the isle of mists.",
    "DialogueData.324.92": "Maybe. One time I sneezed in the library and lightning struck all the desk lamps and puddles formed on the inlaid hardwood panels. I snuck out.",

    "DialogueData.324.93": "You have a strong connection to the energies that served the elderfolk. Funny, I can sense something familiar on the shifting winds. Like a scent from the old nursery.",

    // 2 After Orchard scene
    "DialogueData.324.94": "Blackfeather: The chefs attacked the nursery, and before I could escape with the little apple spirits, we were caught by the foul magics channeled by the traitors.",

    "DialogueData.324.95": "Gelatin's soul-anchor is a darkened bone pumpkin head. He was struck down by Knight Wyrven and sealed here, as per a testimony he left for the descendants of the Circle.",
    "DialogueData.324.96": "Mmmm. I did detect a faint scent of fresh apple danish.",

    "DialogueData.324.97": "Only the powers of chaos can unmake such a horrid artifact, for it was the Great Stream itself that gave us the rite of bones. ",
    "DialogueData.324.98": "The chefs used a twisted version of the rite, and devoured the elemental essence of the forest spirits I cared for to transfrom themselves into undying fiends. How my mother of crows must have felt at this devastation. ",
    "DialogueData.324.99": "(Blackfeather looks towards the Shrine engine door) There is a space nearby where I would often find her at craft with her stellarfolk assistants. ",
    "DialogueData.324.100": "I wonder what she might have done with the broken pieces of the Circle.",

    // 3 After Shrine Engine scene
    "DialogueData.324.101": "Blackfeather: These memories must belong to the Heiress of the Isle of Mists. I think we are meant to understand her perspective on these events.",

    "DialogueData.324.102": "I saw a similar vision one time at the lonely atoll. The lady departed our shores to care for her elderfolk kin, and the circle waned until only the Effigy remained.",
    "DialogueData.324.103": "Yes, what could cause such a well mannered Lady to become a storm-stirring voice that shouts at everything.",

    "DialogueData.324.104": "I remember the atoll you describe. It was a great place to immerse oneself in the energies of the tides and the breezes of the sea. If that is where the wisps linger, then I will accompany you there. ",
    "DialogueData.324.105": "I hope to see what manner of plan my mother of crows devised in the aftermath of the nursery's destruction and my banishment.",

    // 4 After Atoll scene
    "DialogueData.324.106": "Blackfeather: So you have witnessed the crimes against our circle. You have seen how crowmother abandoned us to the zealotry of the Fates. (Blackfeather's eyes flicker turquoise)",

    "DialogueData.324.107": "The Justiciar and the Reaper were determined to bring a rogue celestial to justice for war crimes. Their extremism damned many souls, though I'm not sure why they attacked the Circle. The first farmer had nothing to do with the war.",
    "DialogueData.324.108": "Sorry, I know this was important, but I was distracted by all the fashions on display. The hats.",

    "DialogueData.324.109": "It has everything to do with the circle, as it was formed to guard the change of seasons until the Two Kings returned to perform the rite of bones. ",
    "DialogueData.324.110": "Now the conditions are right, and the two kings will not return, so it is up to us to perform this sacred duty. ",
    "DialogueData.324.111": "We must prepare to break the seals of crows, and return the fallen stars to the firmament of the heavens. ",
    "DialogueData.324.112": "It is time for my, our, retribution. ",

    // 5 Confronting Possessed Blackfeather
    "DialogueData.324.113": "Blackfeather: Successor? Is something amiss? (Blackfeather's turquoise eyes flash like lightning)",

    "DialogueData.324.114": "Those phrases you just used. Successor. Time of Retribution. Guarding the change. Only the Effigy uses those words, as he was taught... by the Lady Beyond the Shore.",
    "DialogueData.324.115": "Well I thought we were going to have a forest picnic, or at least a beach picnic... when are we going to bust out the blanket and jam sandwhiches?",

    "DialogueData.324.116": "(Lady Beyond speaking) So you are clairvoyant. It was I who bargained with the great stream to preserve Blackfeather as a vessel for my return to the valley. Do not fret, she remains, but she will need to tolerate my presence for a time yet. And it appears that you require a final lesson in the power of the Mists.",

    // 6 After Duel
    "DialogueData.324.117": "Blackfeather: I opened myself to receive the Lady's blessing, and she poured several ages of grief and frustration into my mind. I was overwhelmed. She possessed me.",

    "DialogueData.324.118": "The Effigy and I believed that she resigned from the circle to pursue the interests and wellbeing of her people. I suppose it's more complicated.",
    "DialogueData.324.119": "I'm sensible enough to know a time when a witty pun is inappropriate. But that was shocking.",

    "DialogueData.324.120": "She was betrayed, long ago, by someone who caused her and her people no small measure of sorrow. ",
    "DialogueData.324.121": "Even when the war ended, her duties as mistress of the Isles, custodian of the wounded Kings, could not distract her from her grievance. ",
    "DialogueData.324.122": "She returned to the valley, to oversee the settling and restoration of the King's ruined dominion, but not even the friendship she gained here, from a gentle farmer who loved her, could comfort her. ",
    "DialogueData.324.123": "Yet my mother of crows had a plan, and to it the Lady invested all her hopes and vindictiveness. But tragedy ensued, and as time passed, the Kings failed to wake, and the civilisation of the Isles went into decline. ",
    "DialogueData.324.124": "The crows wouldn't answer the Lady, so she turned to Chaos, and in service to the Stream, she was granted a permanence that outlived her fading mind and body. She became mist. She is THE mists. ",
    "DialogueData.324.125": "Forever encircled around the resting place of the Two Kings. Her voice becomes the thunder, and she still awaits her time of retribution. ",
    "DialogueData.324.126": "But for now she is content. You are the hope of those that believe in the crowmother's plan, to restore the harmony that existed before the downfall of the elders and dragons, and to that end, I will follow you.",

    "DialogueData.339.1.108": "I can represent the Great Stream, and Jester will stand in for his precious priestess. Argyle here will provide a token presence for the Artisans. ",

    "DialogueData.339.1.124": "By Yoba's laws, the ritual of undoing requires consensus amongst a party of the Fates, because the powers of the Great Stream can have terrifying consequences on creation. ",
    "DialogueData.339.1.125": "In this case, we'll entreat the Stream to unmake these soul-anchors. It's never been performed on this mortal plane before, as I would imagine the original envoys could probably never agree on anything. ",
    "DialogueData.339.1.126": "If they did they might have tried to delete humanity (Buffin laughs). The court should have sent a bunch of jokers like us to administer the ancient trials, we might have been less serious, but we wouldn't have caused so much strife for the survivors of the war. ",

    "DialogueData.339.1.159": "On clear nights, the Great Stream streaks across the darkened sky. The wind swells, and the mountain howls at the shifting moon. ",

    "DialogueData.339.1.161": "I was bestowed with the title of the successor of the wilds, and I do not resent the burden of knowledge and power, as it draws me closer to my ambition to be in true harmony with nature. ",

    "DialogueData.339.1.167": "Buffin, Agent of Chaos: Time for me to bow out of the low court. I did what I came here to do, at least.",

    "DialogueData.339.1.170": "There's a place for you in the circle, Buffin. I know you followed Jester here to rival his quest with an adventure of your own, but I think you know he relies on your friendship and support.",

    "DialogueData.339.1.175": "Thanks for the offer, farmer, but I've been dreaming about returning to court with the great tale of Carnivellion's exploits. Still, his real story is altogether different from what I imagined. ",
    "DialogueData.339.1.176": "I guess I wanted to dress his legend in triumph, to justify my own desire for pride and adulation, when the reality is, a servant of chaos is devoted to the liberty and wellbeing of all created things, ",
    "DialogueData.339.1.177": "not to personal glory, and we often toil in secrecy and without recognition. ",
    "DialogueData.339.1.178": "(Buffin scrunches her face). Ok ok. I'll stay with you, farmer, and make your lives a little less mundane. Maybe I'll get the chance to make my ancestor proud. ",

    "ConversationData.342.1.247": "Masayoshi and Thanatoshi wanted to arrest and trial the brother because of all the dragons and kingdoms he destroyed. But he's... vanished. Our best chance is to find the sister first. I think she's sealed behind that big gate with the birds. ",

    "ConversationData.343.1.93": "What lies beyond the doors, I know not. The mother of crows referred to it as an imbalance. ",

    "ConversationData.343.1.96": "Foreseeing an age of stagnation, the Mother of Crows bargained with Chaos to elect a time when the balance will be restored. ",

    "ConversationData.343.1.111": "When one guards the change of seasons as long as I have, one comes to respect the importance of new life, even when it's easier to discard it than endure the difficult years of nurturing it. ",

    "ConversationData.343.1.123": "It wouldn't make any difference. He has come to this decision of his own accord.",
    "ConversationData.343.1.124": "Ohhhh... that's why he called himself an Effigy.",
    "ConversationData.343.1.128": "As a guardian of the change, one often sees the progression of a being's whole life, and the satisfaction a being enjoys from the fulfillment of it's created purpose. ",
    "ConversationData.343.1.129": "That is the significance of the rite for me, it means I have fulfilled my purpose. That's how I feel, everyone. I am the missing piece. Continue.",
    "ConversationData.343.1.136": "Blackfeather: The temple of burning passion certainly lived up to it's namesake. Our friend is gone...",
    "ConversationData.343.1.139": "We went for a long walk earlier. The last thing his mentors asked of him was to enjoy the beauty of the valley, and he did. He did well.",
    "ConversationData.343.1.140": "Was he a flaming demon fiend this whole time... like... I ate barbeque and drank tea with that guy... and I had no idea",
    "ConversationData.343.1.144": "He brought the Great Stream to us, and delivered the golden bones. (Blackfeather sighs) I don't want his sacrifice to be in vain, but I'm at a loss as to what's required to complete the rite... ",
    "ConversationData.343.1.145": "(Blackfeather blushes) Of course! You heard him, he called you successor. Successor of the first farmer! I think you're also meant to be here, you're meant to do something.",
    "ConversationData.343.1.151": "Mysterious Warrior: Greetings, powerful one. I am Aldebaran of the Celestial realm. You have freed me from a timeless prison, governed by Chaos.",
    "ConversationData.343.1.154": "Welcome, Aldebaran. I'm the local archdruid. I suppose you, like my friend Blackfeather, were sent to limbo in the event that created the golden bones. How are you feeling?",
    "ConversationData.343.1.155": "Where were you the whole time we were being attacked by a swarm of fire fiends? Under the brazier?",
    "ConversationData.343.1.159": "I suffered a grievous betrayal at the behest of someone I love. My rage has been boundless, but my experiences as a simple wooden creature were real, and present in my mind. ",
    "ConversationData.343.1.160": "Now that I have recovered all my faculties, I require time, time enough to reconcile what I have learned as Effigy of the First Farmer with what I have wrought as the Bull of the Heavens.",

    // Explanation
    "QuestData.329.4": "I harnessed a tremendous amount of woodland power to shake the vault free from its rusting anchor bolts. All that did was broadcast my immense power to every forest spirit in the greater valley area. ",
    "QuestData.329.5": "This was still a great outcome for me, as I sat down in the midst of my little apple friends and presented all the cool stuff in my Druid's reliquary, with commentary on all the spectacular battles and feats of power that led to their acquisition. ",
    "QuestData.329.6": "They were so impressed, they promptly reinstated the whole office to be used by myself as the newly appointed High Antiquarian of the Woodland Realm. I refused the stipend but opted for their adulation instead.",

    // Buffin companion quest

    "QuestData.339.1.2": "The time to perform the Rite of Bones is imminent, but the intricacies of the performance, including what part the Stream of Chaos might play, still remain unclear to us. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.3": "Our local servant of Chaos, Buffin, believes in this matter our goals and hers align, as she is still intent on recovering the remains of her forsaken ancestor, Carnivellion, the Hound of Chaos, the envoy of the Fates who assisted the Mother of Crows with the formulation of the rite. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.4": "For this task, the Crowmother's familiars may be of some use.",

    "QuestData.339.1.5": "With 5-6 hours to spare, perform the Rite of Bones at the quest marker in the molten lair, accessed by using the Luminous Waters relic on Level 100 of the mines.",

    "QuestData.339.1.6": "The Crowmother's old familiars proved themselves as valuable aids in the recovery of Carnivellion's remains from the molten lair beneath the mountain. Buffin was delighted with the recovery, but dismayed to recognise what had been done to her ancestor. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.7": "Whether voluntarily or not, someone had tethered Carnivellion's spirit to a darkened bone anchor, similar to those fashioned by the traitor chefs in their corrupt experiments. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.8": "Buffin was reluctant to entreat the power of the Great Stream to destroy all the soul-anchors we had collected so far, but was inspired by the encouraging presence of the circle and other representatives of the Fates, who agreed to participate in an unjoining ceremony in the Court of Fates and Chaos. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.9": "As the liberated souls departed this plane for the Stream, Carnivellion's phantom lingered, and revealed the folly of Knight Wyrven, who learnt the secrets of Dragon transformation as I did, but could not withstand the insidious influence of Tyrannus Jin, who had slowly turned the knight to tyranny and dragon-lust. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.10": "Long ago, Carnivellion hunted down and deposed Wyrven, but the battle proved fatal for both of them, and they were drawn into the anchor-traps prepared by the traitorous chefs to ensnare their souls. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.11": "While tethered to this plane, Carnivellion has been able to commune with a long lineage of wildman successors, as it was agreed with the Mother of Crows to sanctify two titles, one for a mage, one for a shaman, to observe and pass on the knowledge of the Rite of Bones through the generations. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.12": "It was the Great Stream's will that the current Successor of Shamans challenge me to a contest of brutality, and so I battled against the phantom and a giant bear, who revealed itself to be Linus in transformation. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.13": "Linus was under oath not to reveal himself until the appointed time, but we still cannot proceed without the Successor of Mages, who is none other than Doja, Shadowtin's old client, who has used his knowledge of the rite of bones to enrich himself, and is also obsessed with obtaining the legacy of Dragons. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.14": "While Buffin is dismayed that Carnivellion was defeated and subsequently tormented as an anchored soul, she is encouraged by his bravery in confronting Wyrven, borne by his devotion to the virtues of Chaos, the wellbeing and liberty of all life.",

    "QuestData.339.1.22": "Archdruid, I was unaware that one of your many associates is a servant of Chaos, and very like what one would expect of an agent of the Great Stream. Aloof, intense, and foxy, apparently, according to the Jester cat. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.23": "It is my understanding that there is an element of Chaos inherent in the Rite of Bones. Would you please ask your associate about what they might know? (Buffin awaits in the Court of Fates and Chaos with a new quest)",

    "QuestData.339.1.28": "Alright, alright! You are so insistent, farmer, of course I will help you. All you need to do is task those feathered familiars of yours with the retrieval of my ancestor's remains. ",
    "QuestData.339.1.29": "He's the only one who divined the Great Stream's intent for the rite of bones, and his own bones must be somewhere within the skull-littered underbelly of this mountain. (New companion quest received)",

    "QuestData.339.1.30": "The tale of the Hound of Chaos has always been Buffin's favourite, and now she can write the final chapter. I couldn't bring myself to tell Cabby about Thanatoshi... I hope that doesn't cause trouble later.",

    // Revenant Companion quest
    "QuestData.342.1.2": "The Rite of Bones requires the participation of two individuals, the Successor of the Elements and the Successor of the Wilds. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.3": "Linus has revealed himself as the current titleholder of the Wilds, but it remains to be seen whether the Mage Doja, the one responsible for the shadowrogue infiltration that's pillaged the valley's sacred spaces, will answer to the other title. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.4": "Shadowtin has attempted contact with a member of his former mercenary unit to arrange a meeting with Doja and determine the mage's intentions.",
    "QuestData.342.1.5": "Around 12 noon, with 5-6 hours to spare, cast any rite at the quest icon in the Old Graves.",
    "QuestData.342.1.6": "Shadowtin arranged a meeting with the mage Doja at a neutral location, the Old Graves, but when we arrived, one of Shadowtin's former mercenary comrades showed up instead. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.7": "The remorseful mercenary explained that the meeting arrangment was a ruse to divert our attentions while Doja assaulted the Chapel of the Stars. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.8": "After we planned our response, Shadowtin and his comrade left together to find and reason with the other mercenaries, Jester raced to rally our allies, and I went straight to the Chapel to relieve the Revenant. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.9": "I was too late to prevent Doja from pillaging the chapel coffers. The mage had discerned the truth of Knight Wyrven's research into dragonshifting, and wanted his own access to the Tomb of Tyrannus. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.10": "Shadowtin appeared with Marlon. He had saved the guildsman from death at the hands of mercenaries, but this graceful act spurred the appearance of Macarbi and a host of spectres, intent on arresting the Circle for crimes against the Fates. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.11": "Jester appeared and denounced Macarbi, but she refused to listen. Before the spectres could attack, a host of friendly bats swarmed the chapel and chased them away. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.12": "Revenant confessed to conspiring against the original envoys of the Fates to the valley. His actions saw the downfall of Masayoshi, Carnivellion and the entrapment of Thanatoshi in the tomb of Tyrannus. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.13": "But the Crowmother gave him a chance to redeem himself, and Fortumei, who had accepted the Revenant's prayers for absolution, sent Jester as an agent of reconciliation. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.14": "We still had the matter of Doja to deal with, and though we hastened to the tomb, we were too late to prevent the mage from being completely subsumed by the resurrected spirit of Tyrannus Jin. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.15": "It was a fierce battle, but we could not harm the Dragon-shifted Doja until Thanatoshi reanimated and dealt a deathly blow. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.16": "As morticians, who are immune to death, must be chaperoned to the afterlife, Revenant offered to accompany Thanatoshi there himself, and the two left to the planes beyond in friendship. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.17": "Now that Doja has perished, we have an opportunity to invite a different arcanist to ascend to Successor of the Elements. The Rite of Bones will be performed.",
    "QuestData.342.1.24": "I sent a message through our dwarven contact to my former mercenary unit about a possible parlay with Doja. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.25": "The return message instructs us to meet at a familiar location, the Old Graves. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.26": "It will be up to you to determine if Doja is the Successor of the Elements, and if so, what is necessary to convince, or coerce, him to fulfil his duties.",
    "QuestData.342.1.34": "That's the end of the shadowrogue expedition to the surfaceworld. I'm grateful that I was jettisoned from Doja's doomed cause when I was, though I will always pity the shadow souls that followed him to this tragic end. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.35": "Now to see who will assume the mantle of Successor of the Elements. I hope it's not the esteemed 'Snazzymodius'.",
    "QuestData.342.1.40": "I might have had some ideas about how this would all turn out, but the priestess forbade me from giving too many things away. At least we stopped Shadowtin and Marlon from fighting to the death. ",
    "QuestData.342.1.41": "That was a vision I didn't want to see come to pass. I better send Cabby some flowers to say sorry about the bats.",

    "QuestData.343.1.3": "A long time ago, the Mother of Crows implemented a series of plans and protections to ensure the Circle of Druids would be poised to perform the rite of golden bones. ",

    "QuestData.343.1.5": "After 5pm, cast the Rite of Bones at the questmarker in the Ruined Temple, accessible from the path in the northern part of the Druid's Grove.",
    "QuestData.343.1.6": "Blackfeather escorted the two Successors around the ruined temple of burning passion, and explained that the rite's purpose is to remove the seal on the gate of crows. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.7": "She then revealed that one of the pieces of the golden bones, long protected by the Revenant at the Chapel of the Stars, was absent from the set. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.8": "The Effigy interrupted us to announce that the missing piece is in his possession, and bid me to assist him with it's retrieval. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.9": "We spent time in the grove reminiscing about the journey of the Circle from it's dormancy to revitalisation, and when we returned to the temple, Blackfeather had finished preparations for the rite. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.10": "When she requested the missing piece from the Effigy, he placed himself within the temple brazier. Blackfeather was hesitant to continue, but the Effigy was resolute in his decision. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.11": "Our golem friend burst into flames, and a host of fiery fiends spewed forth, followed by a monstrous manifestation of the rage the golem had suppressed for centuries. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.12": "The power of the Mists was enough to dispell the rage and reveal a golden touched soul anchor. Blackfeather realised that the Successor of the First Farmer also needed to play a role, and when I summoned the familiars, they offered me the crowhammer. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.13": "The tool, once used to make the Effigy, was then used to destroy the anchor. A radiant figure jumped from the dias. He introduced himself as Aldebaran, the fallen star, General of the Order of the Guardians, and Bull of the Heavens.",
    "QuestData.343.1.20": "Well met, archdruid. I've made all the arrangements for the Rite of Bones, and I would love to grant you the place of honour at the ceremony. When you are ready, we can proceed. (New quest received)",

    "QuestData.343.1.34": "I suspected that the Effigy was created to be more than a device to perform the duties of the gardener of the circle in my absence. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.35": "The Bull of the Heavens was severe in his campaigns against those that threatened his sister celestial. He devastated this world. ",
    "QuestData.343.1.36": "I imagine that his incarnation as a wooden Effigy was intended to foster conscientiousness.",

    "QuestData.361.4": "Aldebaran's' presence triggered something within the elderfolk enchantment that had sealed the Gate of Crows. The Wisps enacted another memory of the Lady Beyond the Shore, when she was the heiress of the Isle of Mists, and had a vendetta against her former betrothed. ",
    "QuestData.361.5": "It was the Mother of Crows who convinced the Lady to delay her retribution until Aldebaran's return from the realms of chaos, and so the Lady sealed the gate with the heiress' gift. Now it is open.",
    "QuestData.361.6": "I'm ready to test the enchantment on that gate. (New quest received)",

    "QuestData.361.10": "A dreariness lingers over the moors, where the wildlife has grown ghastly and feral.

    "QuestData.361.11": "By a wicked ritual, his soul and those of his loyal guards were bound to the golden bones, which Aldebaran gently laid in a cairn for the fallen. Drawn by the celestial's presence, the spectres of cultists, led by a deranged witch, attempted to reclaim Aldebaran's soul. ",
    "QuestData.361.12": "By virtue of his new found honour, the spirits of Aldebaran's former honour guard were briefly roused to fight with us, and the cultists were vanquished. Next we will venture further afield, to the Undervalley, and the Castle of the Two Kings.",

    "LoreData.86": "I want to know more about the First Farmer",
    "LoreData.87": "The first farmer was blessed by the elderfolk, the monarchs of the valley, to cultivate and protect this special land. ",
    "LoreData.88": "He and the Circle elders taught me their techniques and stories, that I might be a repository of tradition for future generations of the circle. ",
    "LoreData.89": "Though my former mentor's long gone, I remain, because the power of the elders remain. For now.",

    "LoreData.100": "Who is the Lady Beyond the Shore?",
    "LoreData.101": "The Lady of the Isle of Mists is as beautiful and distant as the sunset on the Gem Sea. She was once a courtier of the Two Kings, from a time before the war. ",
    "LoreData.102": "The first farmer was closest to her in counsel and in conviction. She helped establish the circle and remained here a shortwhile before she was called to the Isle. ",
    "LoreData.103": "(The Effigy's eyes flicker a brilliant turqoise). There is a feeling that comes with my memories of that time, a feeling I cannot describe.",

    "LoreData.114": "What happened after the Lady Beyond left the circle?",
    "LoreData.115": "The Lady never returned to the valley. We received a single letter, to inform us she had become the Mistress of the Isles, ",
    "LoreData.116": "having settled her kin into their enduring slumber, and she continued to fulfill her duty to the Weald and to Yoba. ",
    "LoreData.117": "After a time, I began to hear her voice in the storms, and mist would blanket the valley at odd times. ",
    "LoreData.118": "It became a mark of her presence, a sign of her enduring affection for the sacred places. ",
    "LoreData.119": "The circle weakened in her absence. The First Farmer's attention shifted to other matters, and he began to neglect his duty. ",
    "LoreData.120": "He became obsessed with fanciful ideas, and a desire for something beyond his grasp. Then he left. ",
    "LoreData.121": "For a long time I was alert for his return. ",
    "LoreData.122": "Then, after a century, when it became certain he no longer walked this world, I shut myself away. ",

    "LoreData.133": "Do the Stars have names?",
    "LoreData.134": "The Stars have no names that can be uttered by earthly dwellers. ",
    "LoreData.135": "They exist in the Great Expanse of the celestial realm, and care not for the life of our world, though their light sustains much of it. ",
    "LoreData.136": "The Stars that have shone on you belong to a broken constellation of Sisters, who all mourn for one who fell to our realm. ",
    "LoreData.137": "In fact, the circle of druids afforded a worldly name to the missing Celestial. (Effigy's flaming eyes flicker). Merra. ",

    "LoreData.145": "Tell me how you ended up like this",
    "LoreData.146": "Well now. It's hard to believe, seeing as they are so pretty and we're so, well, plain, but a star, an actual celestial being, came to our world. ",
    "LoreData.147": "She was so radiant, that everyone fell in love with her, the young dove, and she was to become a princess of the elderfolk. ",
    "LoreData.148": "But dragons be dragons, and they wanted the shiny princess for themselves, so we rushed to protect her. ",
    "LoreData.149": "I trained to become a holy warrior of the guardians of the Star, and was accepted into their order. ",
    "LoreData.150": "I survived much of the fighting, but many fell to the wrath of the heavens, so much so that it was hard to know whether our cause was just or folly. ",
    "LoreData.151": "I think for all those lost, Yoba wept, because the Fates were sent to make it right. Our princess dove, however, had already vanished. ",
    "LoreData.152": "The Reaper of Fates tracked me here, and when he found me, he accused me of treason against Yoba. He cursed me, never to die, never to rest, and never to leave. ",
    "LoreData.153": "So I remain here, a feeble skeleton of a man, while the reaper is still out there, still looking for the star that fell so long ago.",

    "LoreData.161": "So, giant bats. Friends of yours?",
    "LoreData.162": "Heh heh. It's the sacred water that gives them vitality, and fills their heads with all the whispers of the mists. ",
    "LoreData.163": "After a few generations they started to speak, shrieking and flapping about, yapping on about the Voice beyond the Shore. ",
    "LoreData.164": "But there's only so much a creature can do before it betrays its nature. ",
    "LoreData.165": "So they hang in the dark. They wait. They sing when it rains.",

    "LoreData.176": "What do you know of Jester and the Fates?",
    "LoreData.177": "Jester serves the Priesthood of the Fates. They weave the cords of destiny into the great tapestry that is the story of the world. ",
    "LoreData.178": "It is said that each member of the clergy serve a special purpose known only to Yoba, and so they often appear to work by mystery and happenchance, by whim even. ",
    "LoreData.179": "(Effigy motions ever so slightly in the direction of Jester) They should not be underestimated or trifled with. ",
    "LoreData.180": "No matter how whimsical they appear, their adherance to the decrees of their high priestess is absolute.",

    "LoreData.188": "Do you think the Effigy could learn the mysteries of the Fates?",
    "LoreData.189": "As powerful as he is, I think he's set in his ways. Set in the past. Well at least I think that's why he doesn't like my tricks. ",
    "LoreData.190": "He talks about the first of the valley farmers all the time. They must have have been good friends. Has he asked you to build a pyre yet? (Jester gives a mischievous smirk)",

    "LoreData.198": "How goes your search for the fallen one?",
    "LoreData.199": "I'm as lost as when I started. But, I have found out something about myself, something embarrassing, even disturbing, and yet, I must accept it. I like to hide in boxes.",

    "LoreData.207": "Tell me more about your kin, the Fates",
    "LoreData.208": "Every Fate of the Priesthood has a special role we're given by Fortumei, the greatest of us, priestess of Yoba. ",
    "LoreData.209": "Some of us are like the fae from your legends, haunting creepy woods and caring for the lives of plants and little things. ",
    "LoreData.210": "For my contribution, well, I've had some pretty cool moments... (Jester is pensive as his voice trails off)",

    "LoreData.218": "Any information you can give me to help Jester find Thanatoshi?",
    "LoreData.219": "Not really, knight guardian, but I hope for my own sake as much as your friend's that he can find the mad reaper, so you can plead with him to let me pass on from this plane. ",
    "LoreData.220": "Just, be careful. The Priesthood of the Fates are the nice guys. The others, the crafters, the morbid ones, and that great crazy thing they call Chaos, they might not be so happy for you to stick your nose into forgotten affairs. ",
    "LoreData.221": "Envoys have visited us before, and the last group settled here, in the valley, somewhere on the banks of the river. ",
    "LoreData.222": "They couldn't agree amongst themselves what to do about the mess the elderfolk and dragons made of this world, ",
    "LoreData.223": "and that was when the Reaper took it upon himself to administer his own kind of justice. (Revenant silently turns to the great open window).",

    "LoreData.234": "I think the Fates sent another envoy, unofficially. Another court entertainer, Buffin.",
    "LoreData.235": "I have started to suspect that the assignment of such indistinguished individuals as envoys of the Fae Court was intentional. The jurisdiction of the Fates has ended, and they cannot act openly. ",
    "LoreData.236": "So it is a time for subterfuge and the gathering of information, of an outward display of weakness and whimsy, so that the seats of the Fae Court might prepare to maneuver in secret. ",
    "LoreData.237": "The Morticians are not known for subtleties, but if the Artisans, the most curious of all the sects, send an undistinguished envoy, then we'll have certainty. ",
    "LoreData.238": "The mysterious games of the Fates are at play in the valley.",

    "LoreData.245": "Doesn't it strike you as a little odd that Buffin's still here?",
    "LoreData.246": "It's how it's always been, farmer. You know, she's a mere moment older than me. When she was born, the artisans knew she would be claimed by Chaos, which is obvious, from the way she looks. And walks. ",
    "LoreData.247": "Anyway, the great oracle, Senkenomei, foresaw how great of an agent of Chaos Buffin would be, and panicked, because balance, or something, so she asked for the next Fate born to be dedicated to the priesthood, to become... A Hero Of Fortune. ",
    "LoreData.248": "Guess who that was? I'll give you a hint, it wasn't someone the oracle wanted at first, because that someone is not priestly in any way, but she grew fond of me eventually. ",
    "LoreData.249": "From that time forth Buffin's been a constant friend because we thought why hate each other just because of some stupid rule about balance. Still. Anything I do she has to do the same or better. Long story short that's probably why she's here. ",
    "LoreData.250": "She's probably trying to outdo me right now in some manner. But she still can't reach the places I do when I lick myself!",

    "LoreData.259": "I've seen the sculpted likeness of the first envoys of the Fates. What were they really like?",
    "LoreData.260": "Eh, the monuments are more symbolic than anything. I remember the Artisan being an ageless beauty. The Justiciar was like Thanatoshi, another seven foot tall staff-wielding thug. ",
    "LoreData.261": "The Hound of Chaos, well, the moniker is deceptive, because that creature was massive. The point is, they weren't cute little creatures of the forest like the court sculptors would have you believe. ",
    "LoreData.262": "The Fae Court sent envoys strong enough to wrestle dragons and arrest celestials. ",
    "LoreData.263": "We could not defy them, and even your scarecrow friend was forbidden to approach them, lest they capture him and 'undo' all of the hardwork that went into making him. ",
    "LoreData.264": "I managed to avoid them all until, well, you've heard that story already. Don't be in any hurry to meet the Reaper.",

    "LoreData.272": "Do you follow the exploits of today's adventurer's guild? The Jester of Fates delivered a portent for one of the members, Marlon.",
    "LoreData.273": "Every time an iteration of some monster-slaying club shows up here I have to convince them that I'm not some evil that arises from my coffin at dusk to feast on the blood of innocents. ",
    "LoreData.274": "I am familiar with the two veterans of the current guild. They rely on me to parlay with the church of bats. Or they'll stay a while and listen while I identify some rare item for them. In regards to the foretelling, ",
    "LoreData.275": "that's probably a burden the envoy wasn't supposed to share with you, knight druid, though I doubt that the Jester is disciplined in the discretion of the Priesthood, unless, well, ",
    "LoreData.276": "there's the possibility that the vision was his. If so, he probably knows how it might or might not work out for Marlon, and may even have some sway. We can only hope he's wise enough to make the right call when it matters.",

    "LoreData.340.1": "What game are you playing here, Buffin?",
    "LoreData.340.2": "A contest of stories, farmer, when I realised how many adventures Jester would have on the mortal plane, and how many travel stories he'll have to share when he returns to court, I ran away from the Great Burrow and hitched a ride on the back of a cosmic whale to get here. ",
    "LoreData.340.3": "It had nothing to do with the fact that I don't want him to get hurt or lonely out here.",

    "LoreData.287": "Our circle now has its own treasure hunter",
    "LoreData.288": "All manner of otherfolk traded and befriended with the first farmer, but he always had the most trouble with the shadowfolk. ",
    "LoreData.289": "It's difficult to see their intentions. It's difficult to see them in any lack of light.",

    "LoreData.297": "Shadowtin doesn't believe in luck. Or chance. Or fortune.",
    "LoreData.298": "I think I get what he wants, I mean, trinkets and shiny things are great. But they aren't everything. He said he'd help me uncover the secret of the Fallen Star, but he doesn't care about my sacred mission. ",
    "LoreData.299": "Still, I think he has a part to play for Yoba in our great purpose. (Jester grins) You can just beat him up again if he tries to double-cross us.",

    "LoreData.307": "From your perspective, the Effigy must seem a strange mystical artifact",
    "LoreData.308": "Of all the constructs embued with the power of the elderfolk, I've never heard of one so loyal to his former master. ",
    "LoreData.309": "I've done my own assessment of the quality of his make. The clothes and head-dress are cheap garbage. And threadbare. ",
    "LoreData.310": "I suspect a large cat has been kneading them, as the back is scratched and covered in fur. ",
    "LoreData.311": "You'll probably need to replace them at some point. Or burn them. The real value in the Effigy is a fashioned inner core that is saturated with elder power. ",
    "LoreData.312": "It's the heart, and the brain. A treasure from the elder age.",

    "LoreData.320": "Jester has no care for treasures.",
    "LoreData.321": "He claims to be a powerful agent of destiny, but he's as blind as a newborn kitten, and naive about the horrors that await him on his quest for the Fallen Star. ",
    "LoreData.322": "I doubt he's been sent by Yoba. I doubt Yoba still cares about any of us.",

    //"LoreData.330": "How did your company come into the service of Lord Deep?",
    "LoreData.330": "How did you become leader of the shadowrogues?",
    "LoreData.331": "The mercenary company started out as a band of professional looters. Which has been a wonderful career for me, as I'm fascinated by the elder age, and the cultural heritage of exotic cultures. ",
    "LoreData.332": "How my motivations diverged from my former associates is a consequence, I suppose, of my over-analytical personality. ",
    "LoreData.333": "The folklore of shadows is enscribed on the surface of the Great Shadow Vessel of our city. The narrative begins with the coalescence of shadows into sentient life by the cosmic power of Lord Deep. ",
    "LoreData.334": "But I have uncovered something to the contrary, a bizarre account that suggests those first enscriptions have been tampered with, and that Lord Deep is a fraud. ",
    "LoreData.335": "It's a dangerous opinion to have in my homeland, as we are a warring people, and he is a warlord of great measure, ",
    "LoreData.336": "but I have come to admire the cultures that we have battled and plundered, and I can't shake these dissident thoughts, that he has burdened and slowly corrupted the people of my city. ",
    "LoreData.337": "I hope my travels and the treasures we uncover yield answers.",

    //"LoreData.346": "I remember a strange man was involved with your gang",
    "LoreData.346": "Can you tell me more about this mage Doja?",
    "LoreData.347": "Doja is what you refer to as an arcanist, and while I know he does not live here, I am purposefully ignorant of his daylight identity. ",
    "LoreData.348": "Some time past, he visited my antiquities shop to contract my shadowrogues to infiltrate the valley, with the explicit aim to re-acquire the dormant powers of the Ancient Ones. ",
    "LoreData.349": "I saw this as an opportunity to conduct my own research, and my constant diversions must have expended Doja's patience, as he inspired my own company to mutiny. ",
    "LoreData.350": "I do not regret my present circumstance. ",
    "LoreData.351": "You're my best chance to determine the legitimacy of Lord Deep's rule over the shadowfolk.",

    "LoreData.360": "What role did Chaos play in the low court?",
    "LoreData.361": "Well my great great predecessor, Carnivellion, was the likeness of that big hunky statue with the large mouth. They called him the Hound of Chaos. ",
    "LoreData.362": "It's a little regarded fact that none of the original envoys returned to report on their administration of the valley. ",
    "LoreData.363": "We only know Thanatoshi is out there, because the morticians do not decease like other entities, their essence must be forcefully returned to the heavenly fields by one of their number. ",
    "LoreData.364": "It's an unofficial bet, but I'll find the bones of the Hound before Jester finds the Reaper. Then I might be able to answer your question. What happened here all those centuries ago?",

    "LoreData.376": "What do you know of Dragonkind?",
    "LoreData.377": "The Lady Beyond declined to dwell on the nature of the aggressors of a war that claimed her kin. What I know of Dragonkind comes from the poetry of myth. ",
    "LoreData.378": "They were the first servants of Yoba, and had diminished long before the event that marks the nadir of their noble race. ",
    "LoreData.379": "Their bones have become the foundation of the otherworld, their potent life essence has become the streams of ether that flow through the planes. ",

    "LoreData.387": "I'm sorry about what happened in the Tomb",
    "LoreData.388": "(Jester looks away) I just... I thought that when we found Thanatoshi, then that would be the end of the 'grand quest'. Now the end seems even further away. ",
    "LoreData.389": "I never met the Reaper before, but I've told a few stories about him, and he was always this great, unbending hero. ",
    "LoreData.390": "Well he didn't seem so great when he was trying to slice our heads off. (Jester looks up) I still haven't informed the Morticians where his broken soul is.",

    "LoreData.398": "Any thoughts on the Ancient ones?",
    "LoreData.399": "Oh I've heard lots of scary tales about those things. Monstrous. Scaley. Big teeth. Warts on their nose (Jester isn't sure about that last one). ",
    "LoreData.400": "They could burn you with a look and make you into roast dinner with a single word! Actually I... (Jester's hairs raise across its backside) get kind of nervous just thinking about them. I'm glad you have my back!",

    "LoreData.408": "So what dragon treasures have you found?",
    "LoreData.409": "I've found this cloak, and this carnyx, and this bear mask. The Dragons would demand the best tributes, of craftsmanship that would inspire an Artisan of the Fates, with the finest materials available. ",
    "LoreData.410": "All Shadowfolk prize ethereal technology, and it's a very competitive society, so I have to carry mine with me at all times.",

    "LoreData.418": "Did you ever get to fight a dragon?",
    "LoreData.419": "Heh heh. Not a chance, the low-born guards like me could only man the ramparts and the great machines designed to strike them from the sky. ",
    "LoreData.420": "The elders had magic to stun and wound the ancient ones, and survive the heat from the hellscape made in the dragons' wake, but it was a lost cause until, well, until someone arrived that could match their strength. ",
    "LoreData.421": "I admit, the form you're able to take now, it's terrifying, but if you can imagine being several times bigger, ",
    "LoreData.422": "with a mind that holds the wisdom of ages and a soul that's even older, then you'll have an idea what the original dragons were like. ",
    "LoreData.423": "I would not want to see them take to the skies of our realm again, that's for sure.",

    "LoreData.431": "Is chaos older than the dragons?",
    "LoreData.432": "Chaos has 'been' since the beginning, since the void, since the ether, which spawned a multitude of ancient races, of which the dragons either devoured or subjugated, in their ascent to become the single masters of the ether. ",
    "LoreData.433": "But they could never tame Chaos, and perhaps some might have served it, if they weren't so arrogant. The Saurus though, the other great race of lizards, they favoured the Stream. They all perished though. ",
    "LoreData.434": "A shame, but such is the nature of chaos, it possesses no permanence. It is the true opposition of destiny woven by the Fates Priesthood.",

    "LoreData.446": "About the old circle, what can you tell me of Knight Wyrven?",
    "LoreData.447": "Good Knight Wyrven was the most senior of the Guardians that survived the war. In those times all the disparate factions of humans banded together to settle disputes and rebuild communities. ",
    "LoreData.448": "Then the Fates arrived, and their interference unsettled Wyrven the most. He believed humanity should be completely autonomous, and from the few interactions I had with him, it appeared to me he sought the power to claim that autonomy. ",
    "LoreData.449": "He was most interested in the shapeshifting traditions of calico, and visited the valley to converse with those shamans that forsook their dragon-serving traditions to become Druids. I'm not sure if his efforts proved worthwhile.",

    "LoreData.458": "About the old circle, what can you tell me of the brothers Cannoli and Gelatin?",
    "LoreData.459": "The brothers were stewards of the Weald. They served in the kitchens during the conflict, and when the circle was founded, their knowledge of all the different varieties of flora and fauna proved invaluable to our efforts. ",
    "LoreData.460": "Cannoli even claimed he and Gelatin were pastry chefs to the royal court, in the personal service of the elderfolk prince of the Isles. ",
    "LoreData.461": "Despite their oaths to the Weald, the brothers fell to wickedness, and had to be put down by Wyrven's guardians, though I never got to witness the fight, or attend the funerary rites. ",
    "LoreData.462": "It was about the time the Fates and their zealots began to openly oppose the circle. Wyrven and the rest retreated to the mountain. The First Farmer told me to hide. ",
    "LoreData.463": "Though it pains me to admit my suspicions, it appears he abandoned the circle, to pursue unrequited love across the gem sea. When I finally emerged from the cave, the circle was gone.",

    "LoreData.471": "I think you were right about Shadowtin, he's proven himself",
    "LoreData.472": "When we were fighting him and his buddies, I pounced on burgundy boy as soon as I could. ",
    "LoreData.473": "I thought I would rip off his mask and reveal his face to the world, and it would be like an awesome moment, ",
    "LoreData.474": "with him yelling, and me saying some punch line in a deep, serious voice like, 'Face us with your real face, Shadowman'. ",
    "LoreData.475": "Anyway, soon as I touched him I saw a vision of him and you, working together, except he was a cat, like me, ",
    "LoreData.476": "so I thought maybe that means we will combine our powers and become a super team. So that's why I wanted to give him a chance. I'm glad I was right.",

    "LoreData.484": "The Mother of Crows. Why would you keep the identity of the Artisan of the Fates, the one that accompanied Thanatoshi and the other original envoys, a secret?",
    "LoreData.485": "Because she swore me to secrecy. I still cannot reveal the few details I know about what transpired when the Crowmother was here, and why, or who, for that matter. ",
    "LoreData.486": "I am bound by dual terms, to the Artisans and the Morticians, as you know now, that is how the Fates operate, always a dichotomy, tied at both ends. ",
    "LoreData.487": "I can only say that the crowmother will return for the rite of bones. How that's going to happen is beyond me. ",
    "LoreData.488": "She was old when she left, and even Fates have limited life spans according to their purpose, so she'll be ancient bones by now, maybe even the bones referred to in the foretelling. ",
    "LoreData.489": "I hope you sort this all out soon, knight druid. ",

    "LoreData.497": "Did the Great Stream witness what happened here after the War for the Star?",
    "LoreData.498": "This is what I remember from the account scrawled on one of the walls of the Chaos sanitarium, written by the Watcher who surmised these events from the patterns of the Stream. ",
    "LoreData.499": "When the dragons perished, waves of liberated, ethereal energy swept across the realms, and from this, the artisans set to work, capturing and organising this energy into new forms. ",
    "LoreData.500": "The Stream observed this artifice, and was displeased, as the designs possessed no nuances of interest, for they were boring, mechanical and utilitarian. ",
    "LoreData.501": "So the Stream sabotaged the craft, and from the imperfections, the elementals emerged, and were unleashed upon this world. It was the advent of the arcane epoch. ",

    "LoreData.514": "When will you return to the darkened plane?",
    "LoreData.515": "My folk have been slowly consumed by the hunger of a tyrant, who expends the lives of our best folk to construct his fortresses and continue his conquests, ",
    "LoreData.516": "all under the pretense that we are his property, his souls to enflame and extinguish to his purposes. ",
    "LoreData.517": "I want to expose him as an imposter, before he gains the power of dragons and heaps the souls of my people into an engine of war, and to do that I need the truth of his past.",
    "LoreData.518": "Unequivocable testimony of his fraud. I cannot return empty-handed.",

    // Effigy Bones
    "LoreData.320.3": "It seems that you were made by the mother of crows and the princess of the mists to replace Blackfeather when she was lost to the realm beyond. The Weald needed a protector.",
    "LoreData.320.4": "Indeed. I am content with the purpose given to my creation, though I do not consider myself to have the gentle touch needed to nurture the elementals of the forest, and I do wonder about the possibilities of a new life free from duty to my old friends. ",
    "LoreData.320.5": "Yet, even with such thoughts, I feel a sense of weariness and desire to rest from the burdens I've carried for so long.",

    // Jester Bones
    "LoreData.320.6": "I haven't had the pleasure of meeting an Artisan of the Fates. What are they like?",
    "LoreData.320.7": "I guess, well, to a human, all the fates must seem like crazy creatures. I would say the artisans take the prize for being the most weird. ",
    "LoreData.320.8": "There aren't many of them, and they only accept the most clever members into their forge-holds, which they barely leave, unless they want everyone to witness a prototype test, or they get summoned to court to answer for some unexpected side effects. ",
    "LoreData.320.9": "Oh, I remember there was this dimensional inversion door. ",
    "LoreData.320.10": "You have to walk into it backwards to come out forwards, and everything you say comes out like a riddle, all back to front. We tried to push a sphinx through it to force her to talk sense.",

    // Revenant Bones
    "LoreData.323.1": "When the traitor druids attacked the circle, Knight Wyrven stood against them. Were you there as well?",
    "LoreData.323.2": "No, no I was not. That whole affair was just one of a few stabs in the back for the combined ranks of the guardians and druids. I'm sure more truths will come to light as you hasten towards the rite of bones. ",
    "LoreData.323.3": "My own shameful act included. That will be the time. The time to settle all the old debts.",

    // Buffin Bones
    "LoreData.323.4": "Buffin, did your ancestor Carnivellion play a role in the downfall of the Circle?",
    "LoreData.323.5": "When the elementals emerged, many of the mortal races were forced to adapt to the presence of the arcane. Some, such as the stellarfolk, harnessed the elementals for their own purposes, and many achieved the zenith of their civilisations. This displeased the stream, which did not want to see its new creations subsumed by the old orders. ",
    "LoreData.323.6": "My ancestor came to represent the elementals in the low Court. It was he who helped the crowmother build the nursery, restricted the technomatic ambitions of the dwarves, and opposed the authoritarian edicts of the brothers, perhaps leading to his own destruction. I will know the truth of it when I find his bones. ",

    // Shadowtin Bones
    "LoreData.323.7": "Is there anything in the texts you studied about a rite of bones?",
    "LoreData.323.8": "The fall of Dragons created a vacuum of power across many dominions, and those with the ability to wield the unleashed tides of ether became the new Lords. This is what I think the rite of bones is about, a mechanism to seal the extraordinary residual power of the old war in the twilight realms of the Fates, ",
    "LoreData.323.9": "where they cannot tempt or corrupt mortals, lest a new tyranny abound. It appears the mother of crows was successful in sealing great power here, though it cost your forebearers much, and despots like Doja and Lord Deep seem intent on breaking through. But you are here to stop them. It's no coincidence powers have been afforded to you to fight tyranny.",

    // Blackfeather Self 1
    "LoreData.323.10": "What was it like, to be imprisoned within the Dust Chef?",
    "LoreData.323.11": "I was barely conscious of it, if it was a thing at all. The last memory I have from before you liberated me is the craven face of the chefs as they assaulted the nursery. Your scholar friend, with the facial apparatus, posits that the effects of the rite of bones practiced by the traitors resulted in temporal transference. ",
    "LoreData.323.12": "He talked at length about the blind purgatories that exist beyond the voided plane, where the stream of chaos flows. The stream might have held my naked, sleeping body within its tendrils, to place back into this realm at it's whim. I'm trying not to freak out about it.",

    // Blackfeather Self 2
    "LoreData.323.13": "Do you intend to remain a Gardener of the Circle?",
    "LoreData.323.14": "Hope has been put in my heart, seeded by the mother of crows and watered by the princess of the isles. What's more, I recognise the Stream of Chaos held me in safety until it was time to see these hopes start to bud. ",
    "LoreData.323.15": "So I will remain a steadfast gardener of the Weald. In any case, I may have to retrieve such duties from your friend the Effigy, as I sense he will have an outsized role in the trials ahead of us.",

    // Keeper Memories
    "LoreData.329.3": "What were the folk of the Isles doing in the lands of the Weald?",
    "LoreData.329.4": "The maw of the abyssal trench widens with every passing age. This phenomenon has always threatened the sea colonies of the elderfolk of the Isles, though they were unprepared for the hour when their greatest city succumbed to the sinking power of the abyss. ",
    "LoreData.329.5": "The Prince of the Isles inherited his title from his drowned liege and father, and embarked to these shores to seek aid and council from the Two Kings. His attentions soon shifted from the plight of his people to the desires of his own heart.",

    "LoreData.329.6": "What caused the Two Kings to fall into endless slumber?",
    "LoreData.329.7": "A Celestial descended from the heavens to grace the Woodland realms. For a time, as they fawned over the radiance of the star, the Two Kings stopped warring over the seasons. They gardened their palaces, wrote ballads, made wine and played music. ",
    "LoreData.329.8": "Still, the world turns, the seasons must change, and the old conflicts resumed. But the stakes had changed. The ancient ones, the dragons, desired the starlight for their own dominions, and their draconic might overpowered the courts of both Kings.",

    "LoreData.329.9": "The dragons have disappeared. Does that mean the elderfolk won the war?",
    "LoreData.329.10": "Blessings of power were granted by the heavens to those who swore to defend the Celestial, now a princess amongst the elderfolk, against the dragon onslaught. After the Kings were wounded in the battle of the fields of Winter, the dragon alliance laid siege to the Eldercastle. ",
    "LoreData.329.11": "The wrath of heavens descended upon the ancient ones, broke the siege and rallied the surviving forces of the Weald, the Isles and the Knolls. ",
    "LoreData.329.12": "The tyrant realm of Calico was the first to fall in the counterattack, and then the war abated. The Celestial princess had vanished. Neither side could account for her disappearance, and they turned from war with empty hands and broken hearts.",

    "LoreData.343.1.11": "Were you aware that Linus was the Successor of the Wilds?",
    "LoreData.343.1.12": "I inevitably encounter all who have been blessed by Chaos with the mark of the Wilds. The man Linus received his blessing late in his life, after many years spent detaching himself from the cultured world of his youth. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.13": "One afternoon, the bear Linus stumbled upon our grove, and after he ingested all the autumn forage, he fell asleep next to the larger menhirs of the grove. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.14": "When he awoke, the energies of the standing stones gave him a riveting education in the powers of the old Weald and the expectations of the Great Stream. I observed in stealth, as I had I adopted the stance of a idle scarecrow perched against the Magnolia tree. My deception was excellent.",

    "LoreData.343.1.23": "Blackfeather and Carnivellion were imprisoned in a limbo governed by the Great Stream. What's that like?",
    "LoreData.343.1.24": "The Great Stream can not really be explained by the terms that define the properties of your material plane. If you consider it a river, it's one with a current that flows around and over you, but stripes away your clothes, and then your skin and hair, and whatever it touches next, ",
    "LoreData.343.1.25": "because to be immersed in the Stream is to surrender the essence of self, and be dematerialised into the unrealised potential of creation. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.26": "The limbos are islands of refuge in the stream. You can retain your self there, but all that you can sense is whatever else is put in the same little pocket. You could torment someone forever by putting them in limbo with their worst aggravation. Like regret. Or bees.",

    "LoreData.343.1.35": "How confident are you that Doja is the Successor of the Elements?",
    "LoreData.343.1.36": "The arcanic epoch followed the devastation of dragons, when the new elements emerged, and that is all most arcanists know. To most mages, such as the one we encountered at the ethereal nexus, the mythic powers are of no consequence, but Doja is singularly different. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.37": "I am convinced he had foreknowledge of the soul anchors, the rite of bones, and the history of the sacred spaces of this valley. I imagine he received these insights from an agent of Chaos, or the Great Stream itself marked him as it did your wildman friend. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.38": "We will only gain the answers from Doja himself.",

    "LoreData.343.1.47": "When we released Carnivellion's spirit, he mentioned a confrontation with Wyrven and the traitor chefs.",
    "LoreData.343.1.48": "Well that's old news to me, knight druid. For a brief moment after the old war, all the survivors were aligned in hope and purpose, and the alliance of druids and guardians was strong. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.49": "But when the chefs betrayed the Circle, and we lost the elderfolk and farmers, the guardians were all that remained to suffer the whims of the envoys of the Fates. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.50": "One thing we wouldn't do is give up our oaths to the fallen star, and at times those oaths had us act more like warring soldiers than peacekeepers, but when Wyrven fell, the alliance was truly finished. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.51": "I was cursed for my role. It's old news.",

    "LoreData.343.1.62": "The vision you had about Marlon, was it averted, or just delayed?",
    "LoreData.343.1.63": "It changed, farmer, because he no longer walks the path that leads to that destiny. He can still change course and go back that way, if he wants, but that would be dumb, I mean, he got a free pass from the Fates! ",
    "LoreData.343.1.64": "It was a pretty cool moment. I owe it all to my dear High Priestess Fortumei, for believing I could be of use here. Still, it's not the only vision I've gotten. I see a pyre, and a burning figure, and a night sky turned red with rage. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.65": "I don't know what it means. Being a powerful visionary of the Priesthood sucks sometimes.",

    "LoreData.343.1.74": "The Last Guardian of the Stars has travelled to the Fields Beyond the Fae",
    "LoreData.343.1.75": "I am comforted to know that the revenant knight has found peace with the Fates. For as long as I've been sentient, he has led a solitary vigil at the chapel, guarding the golden bones. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.76": "I am filled with conflicting thoughts. I was instructed to await the rite of bones, but also instructed to enrich myself with experience of the natural world, to give my own vigil meaning. I wonder if I've done enough.",

    "LoreData.343.1.85": "Doja proved to be an unreliable Successor of the Elements",
    "LoreData.343.1.86": "I heard about the irresponsible behaviour of the mage. Fortunately, we have attained the services of a more reputable candidate, but it will be a greater effort to appeal to the Great Stream of Chaos to accept the rite of bones. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.87": "There's something else too, which the scholarly shadowman illuminated to me. The two Successors we've gathered represent Chaos, but what about the Mother of Crow's side of the bargain... ",
    "LoreData.343.1.88": "I've surmised that my role as Caretaker of the Weald is important, as that's why I'm here, really, and I'm very anxious about it. I don't want to fail the Mother, yet I'm filled with doubt that I'm missing something. Do you know of any other successors?",

    "LoreData.343.1.99": "Is the Effigy of the First Farmer lost forever?",
    "LoreData.343.1.100": "Materially, yes. Spiritually, no. When they used the golden core to animate the Effigy, it was as a conduit for drawing power from the boundless celestial realm. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.101": "A byproduct of this effect was the transmission of multiple facets of my own soul and personality. My intellect, my insecurities, the rage I felt in my final moments before banishment. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.102": "Wisdom, memory, purpose, these were all absent, and had to be developed separately in golem form. It's as if I experienced a second adolescence, and I am informed by both. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.103": "Two unhappy childhoods? (Aldebaran laughs) Perhaps they weren't so bad.",

    "LoreData.343.1.112": "You mentioned betrayal",
    "LoreData.343.1.113": "Yes, a moment of shock and humiliation in the lands beyond the Gate of Crows. I was brought low amongst the captains of my legion, and before I collapsed, my last glimpses of light were of Merra's radiant face as she turned from me. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.114": "I suppose I was banished to limbo shortly afterwards, as I awoke as a golem, oblivious, but as angry as I ever was. I tormented the Lady of the Isles and my friend the First Farmer with my outbursts. She practiced the ways of the Mists to better pacify me. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.115": "(Aldebaran smiles) I think she referred to my outbursts as tantrums.",

    "LoreData.343.1.124": "You've found the fallen star, the one the Reaper hunted",
    "LoreData.343.1.125": "Yea. We did it. Ok, hear me out. Would it be right to try to drag our new friend before the Fae court, even if we could overpower him, for crimes that happened AGES ago, when there's another celestial out there who could speak in his defense? ",
    "LoreData.343.1.126": "As far as I'm concerned the job's only half done.",

    "LoreData.343.1.135": "How fares the shadowrogues?",
    "LoreData.343.1.136": "They've embarked on a journey to loot Doja's estate. I declined to be their leader again. I want to focus on my studies, and what interests me the most right now are the implications of this Rite of Bones.",

    "LoreData.343.1.145": "Was the Great Stream pleased with the Rite of Bones?",
    "LoreData.343.1.146": "I think it was just the pre-show entertainment, farmer. Portents of danger and mystery echo through the burrows of the servants of chaos. I'm here to see what happens. To Jester. Cabby and I have a few bets going about him.",

    "LoreData.343.1.155": "I think you made the Mother of Crows proud",
    "LoreData.343.1.156": "We managed in the end, didn't we. I'm relieved, and a little ashamed of myself for not thinking about the participation of the familiars sooner. You've formed a great relationship with them, and it showed. ",
    "LoreData.343.1.157": "The rite didn't produce the result I expected, but it is delightful none the less, to know the Effigy was a nascent aspect of the great hero Aldebaran. I suppose he's the key to opening the gate of crows.",

    "LoreData.372.1": "The Bear Rock",
    "LoreData.372.13": "(Lore) The sheared face of the rock is covered in markings.",
    "LoreData.372.14": "There are several enscriptions, representing several moments of discovery and custodianship of the orchard.",
    "LoreData.372.2": "The first enscription is rendered in antiquated runic. Below it is a paraphrased transcription in a second hand.",
    "LoreData.372.3": "Know This, I, Septentrio, Reclaimed The Grove Of The First Successors. ",
    "LoreData.372.4": "This Monolith Bears Testament To The Victory Of The Wilds Over The Old Fiends. My Axe Delights In The Splatter.",
    "LoreData.372.5": "The letters of the second enscription are perfect in dimension, as if punched by magic.",
    "LoreData.372.6": "I, Woednes, Seer of the Elements, invoke a covenant here. I have replanted the grove, unearthed and restored the dwarven engineum, and if the habitations I've designed are maintained, life will continue to flourish here. ",
    "LoreData.372.7": "By some mystery the successors of the old order will be drawn to this place. I beseech them to follow my example. Seek illumination. Respect the Elements. Abide by the covenant.",
    "LoreData.372.8": "The third enscription is fraught and haphazard, as if etched by talon rather than tool.",
    "LoreData.372.9": "Successor, be warned. Heed not the words of the Seer. I have had visions. Mist. Crows. Fiends, and an awful secret, buried here. ",
    "LoreData.372.10": "The door is shut. The owls have fled. Forsake this place, as the circle did. ",

    // Wizard
    "LoreData.377.9": "Have the agents of Chaos accepted you as Successor of Elements?",
    "LoreData.377.10": "The quibblings of the elementals remain as indecipherable as ever, and I have not conducted any business with those that serve chaos. ",
    "LoreData.377.11": "I have sent your shadowfolk mercenaries to investigate the sanctum of the Mage Doja. When it is appropriate, I will avail myself of the trappings of the office he dishonoured.",

    "LoreData.377.20": "I've heard rumours that you've been the wizard in the tower for centuries",
    "LoreData.377.21": "The former resident of the tower retired after I defeated him in a duel. I had become bewitched by the beauty of his daughter, and came to the Valley to win her hand in marriage. ",
    "LoreData.377.22": "I was unaware of a long tradition of the progeneration of daughters to wizards, and despite my wife's pleas for children, I feared a suitor may one day come to challenge me. ",
    "LoreData.377.23": "In her desperation, my wife stole my magic ink, and with it, the power to produce a child by dark ritual. I suspect she was successful. ",
    "LoreData.377.24": "She may have assumed a new identity and raised the daughter, or son, on her own.",

    // Caroline
    "LoreData.377.33": "How did you become an arcanist?",
    "LoreData.377.34": "Well that takes me back... When we moved here, we didn't have a lot of money or opportunities. I became the familiar to a witch who lived at the old tower in the forest. ",
    "LoreData.377.35": "I did dictation, cooking, herb gathering, laundry, and she taught me the mysteries of the arcane world. ",
    "LoreData.377.36": "I discovered a love of herbalism and brewing. That's how I practiced power over frost, I wanted to protect my saplings from the chill of the morning.",

    "LoreData.377.45": "So why did you quit the arcane arts?",
    "LoreData.377.46": "Oh, my mistress became... unsettled. I remember that she was prone to fits of rage, and I was often shut out with orders to fetch ingredients for a remedy. ",
    "LoreData.377.47": "The truth is, she had become curious about the darker arts. Some of the weird things she asked for couldn't be gathered from the countryside. ",
    "LoreData.377.48": "I had to seek the services of a general importer through Pierre's contacts. They weren't entirely comfortable with some of the orders.",
    "LoreData.377.49": "I was expecting Abigail, and I didn't think that the tower was the right environment for a newborn.",

    // Linus
    "LoreData.377.58": "What purpose does Chaos give to the successor of wilds?",
    "LoreData.377.59": "I haven't dwelt in the valley for long. You could almost say I'm a migratory animal, following the packs across the untamed lands of this world. ",
    "LoreData.377.60": "I think I was drawn here, like that rogue mage Doja, to answer to the Rite of Bones. What I know of the old circle of Druids comes from local history books in the library. ",
    "LoreData.377.61": "Still didn't answer a lot of questions about the rite, and my furried feet were starting to get restless. I'm glad you showed up and got things moving.",

    "LoreData.377.70": "Why do you want to be alone?",
    "LoreData.377.71": "I've always heard other voices. Their words that travel on the wind, that sing in the rain, that rumble through the earth. ",
    "LoreData.377.72": "They would shout at me in the city, so loud, I couldn't stand it anymore. ",
    "LoreData.377.73": "Out here in the open air the voices are quieter. Even quieter if I'm immersed in a good book. ",
    "LoreData.377.74": "So I linger in the peaceful spaces, and I only visit the town at night, when all are asleep. ",
    "LoreData.377.75": "It didn't take long to hear the wild cries of those that serve Chaos.",

    // Clint
    "LoreData.377.84": "How much do you know about the legends of the valley?",
    "LoreData.377.85": "I've heard plenty stories of danger from my father and his father. ",
    "LoreData.377.86": "Enough to remind me to carry a heavy-duty weapon whenever I go near the mines or deep woods. ",
    "LoreData.377.87": "My father was a serious man, kind of like that old man Gil, and Marlon, always watching for a long defeated evil to stir and threaten the good folk. ",
    "LoreData.377.88": "So I learnt to make weapons and practice my hammer strokes. Its so boring, you know, and not as heroic as I thought it might be. ",
    "LoreData.377.89": "I've enjoyed only a few moments of silliness in my life. Silly like the kind of fun that uh, I see Emily having...",

    "LoreData.377.98": "Your hammer looks like a relic of old world",
    "LoreData.377.99": "It comes from the Knell, the kingdom of the elderfolk. My ancestors served as labourers and smiths to the craft-masters there. They built great halls within the knolls, and castles in the secret valleys. ",
    "LoreData.377.100": "Apparently a royal bloodline of the knollfolk runs through generations of my family. I hope not, the legends say they were bigger than most folk, kind of like ogres. Might explain why I love meat so much. ",
    "LoreData.377.101": "But the power of the Knellhammer does answer to me, and I feel it is my duty to marry and raise an hier. If only women were interested in big hammers and old stories.",

    // Marlon
    "LoreData.377.110": "Why did you establish the adventure guild?",
    "LoreData.377.111": "It was born out of a personal challenge to myself, to brave the highest peaks and confront the fiercest fiends of the dark places. Many spirited adventurers have taken up this call. ",
    "LoreData.377.112": "Thus, adventure tourism became a thing, and I have profited from this venture, to where I can enjoy a comfortable retirement out here in the valley. ",
    "LoreData.377.113": "Also the dry, warm Foehn winds of the mountainside are good for my joints.",

    "LoreData.377.122": "I braved the depths of the skull caverns and defeated the greatest fiends there. What else is there to face?",
    "LoreData.377.123": "It never seems like enough, does it. There's always a new treasure, always a new threat, lurking in the deep spaces. ",
    "LoreData.377.124": "I've come to suspect a hidden force is driving the slimes out of their gloop, the shadowfolk out of their dens. ",
    "LoreData.377.125": "Listen, those large bats, the ones that can screech words? Sometimes they whisper about the 'other', an entity other than the Lady they worship. ",
    "LoreData.377.126": "I often think about the old warrior's warning, that we struggle not against flesh and blood, but against dark powers in high places. ",
    "LoreData.377.127": "Is there something out there, playing with us?",

    // Gunther
    "LoreData.377.136": "How did you become the local custodian?",
    "LoreData.377.137": "I was drawn to the unfinished research of the esteemed scholar, M. Jasper. ",
    "LoreData.377.138": "He was fascinated by the old accounts of a war between a forgotten race of proto-humans and great lizards, or dragons, if you will. ",
    "LoreData.377.139": "It's no secret that the valley possesses ore of special quality, and most of it has been extracted from the mountainside when the mine was operational. ",
    "LoreData.377.140": "Mister Jasper's research led him into the communities of many secret races, even Goblins, Dwarves and Shadowfolk, though he managed to obtain very few primary sources to support his 'elderfolk' theories. ",
    "LoreData.377.141": "'No bones' is often a refrain of his notes. So I have dedicated myself to continuing his research, and finding ancient burial sites for a pre-cataclysmic race, but alas, no leads thus far.",

    "LoreData.377.151": "I hope your research into Elderfolk has benefited from your time with the Circle. Any conclusions?",
    "LoreData.377.152": "Jasper proposed a secreted isle across the gem sea as the probable final resting place for this ancient civilisation of elderfolk, and by your testimony and the accounts of this Lady Beyond the Shore, that appears to be the likely conclusion. ",
    "LoreData.377.153": "I have some questions... if the Lady made a deal with Chaos to protect and perpetuate this sanctuary, what of the abyssal maw that threatens the civilisation of the isles? To what agent of Chaos was this deal brokered? ",
    "LoreData.377.154": "Jaspers notes are riddled with references to dark forces interfering with the historical record of the elderfolk, obfuscating accounts, removing physical remains. It was enough to scare him, to make him abandon his research. Should I be afraid?",

    // Dwarf
    "LoreData.377.164": "How profitable is the bomb-making business these days?",
    "LoreData.377.165": "Great, really. Can't make a new home under the mountains without buying a lot of bombs! We have to keep making homes too, because the shadowfolk keep raiding us. ",
    "LoreData.377.166": "They are getting bolder and bolder as the years pass, and we just don't have the numbers or the willpower to hold them off for long. The Deep One's forces continue to grow, and who will stand against him? ",
    "LoreData.377.167": "The time of the elderfolk has ended, and the dwarves? We care not for much outside our troves and mountain holds. No, it is in men we must trust. Wait, what am I even saying, men are weak. Will the Druids save us?",

    "LoreData.377.177": "My friend referred to you as a stellarfolk. Does that mean anything?",
    "LoreData.377.178": "Yea. We came from the star plane. They say we rode the great streams of ether on big ships. Then the dragons died, and the paths between worlds closed. ",
    "LoreData.377.179": "But that was ok, because the arcane epoch started, and we were able to build big cities and magic weapons! So there was a big war, and a lot happened, and at the end of it arcanic devices were banned by the smart ones. ",
    "LoreData.377.180": "Now we stick to good old black powder.",

    // Krobus
    "LoreData.377.190": "How profitable is the dark-market business these days?",
    "LoreData.377.191": "Good, thank Yoba, I was blessed with a great spot for business. A lot of underworld creatures travel through those sewers, back and forth from the caverns to the sea. ",
    "LoreData.377.192": "Some pay in republic credits, though I'm not sure what to do with all the cash. Can I hire a human to extend the sewer system? Perhaps put up some fancy signs that darken in the glowing light?",

    "LoreData.377.202": "Were you cast out of shadowfolk society?",
    "LoreData.377.203": "We come from the voided side of the celestial plane, the shadowy abyss. We were stranded here when the way between worlds crashed. ",
    "LoreData.377.204": "Those pesky dwarves were also stuck here. Then someone gave us a home, the Deep One, the Great Prince. A big city under the world, protected from the sun and the disdain of other races. ",
    "LoreData.377.205": "But he does not revere Yoba. How can that be? How can one not abide by the wisdom of the Fates, and the majesty of the celestials... Then there was war. ",
    "LoreData.377.206": "My family had a long history of protesting the war, for we believe it defies Yoba's laws. They were cast out, and I was born in exile. I've never had a real home.",

    // Moors lore
    "LoreData.385.1": "The High Moors",
    "LoreData.385.2": "The Weald was once a vibrant woodland. It encompassed the valley and much of the surrounding highlands and plains. The Elderfolk have long since departed, and what remains of the Two King's inner domain has become a cold moorland.",
    "LoreData.385.3": "The high moors can be accessed through the Gate of Crows, above the broken Temple of Burning Passion.",
    "LoreData.385.4": "Cairns and cenotaphs have been erected near the upper pass of the moors. Some of these monuments might serve a special purpose.",

    // Astarion
    "LoreData.388.2": "I didn't know elves had fangs, were you born with them?",
    "LoreData.388.3": "Oh, darling, if only they were hereditary. No, they were a gift. Or a price. ",
    "LoreData.388.4": "I was important once, you know, dashing, brilliant, probably insufferable. Made a few enemies, naturally.",
    "LoreData.388.5": "Some of those misguided fools left me bleeding out in an alley, which, as it turns out, was the least of my problems, well, when it comes to blood. ",
    "LoreData.388.6": "The fangs are the price I paid to live. ",

    "LoreData.388.7": "Who saved you from bleeding out?",
    "LoreData.388.8": "A dark master of the night, someone who sought to take advantage of my elegant charm and irresistible good looks. ",
    "LoreData.388.9": "A real tight-ass, and not in the endearing way. He... preyed on my vulnerabilities, and my desires, and I served his. ",
    "LoreData.388.10": "I'm finally free, as much as I'm my own Lord, but my former master made sure I'll carry the scars and curse of his benevolence, forever.",
